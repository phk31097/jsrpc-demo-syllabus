# JsrpcDemoSyllabus

The purpose of this project is to showcase the [JSRPC library](https://github.com/phk31097/jsrpc) by creating a basic syllabus application.

It should be possible to

 - Load courses
 - Filter courses by a text input

which is essentially a GET request.

## How to use it

### Client

Use `ng serve` anywhere in this project. The development server will be available under localhost:4200

### Server

Use `npx @philippkoch/jsrpc start-server` inside src/server to run the development server

Hint: In order to use this application locally, you might have to disable CORS restrictions in your browser.
